# Surveying and Mapping of the WLE Building

## 📍 Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of the **CE331: Principles of GeoInformatics** course to perform a detailed geospatial survey of the **WLE (Western Lab Extension) Building** area within our institute. The primary objective was to document the layout, elevation, and spatial features of the site and produce an accurate map using modern surveying instruments and GIS tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Establish a **Closed Traverse** network for spatial referencing.
- Measure **side lengths and interior angles** of the traverse.
- Perform **levelling** operations using Auto Level.
- Capture **global coordinates** using GNSS receivers.
- Survey and record **site features** including trees, buildings, and roads.
- Adjust traverse data using **Bowditch's Rule**.
- Compile and visualize the data in **QGIS**.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance
- Site inspection and selection of optimal **control points** (CPs).
- Consideration of terrain features and visibility for accurate surveying.

### 2. Levelling
- Conducted levelling using an **Auto Level** instrument.
- Ensured a closure error within acceptable limits (≤10 mm).

### 3. Traversing
- Measured distances and angles between CPs using a **Total Station**.
- Calculated local coordinates and adjusted using Bowditch's Rule.

### 4. GNSS Coordinate Integration
- Captured GNSS coordinates at selected CPs.
- Used **Similarity Transformation** to align local coordinates with the global reference frame.

### 5. Feature Mapping
- Mapped features such as **trees, fountains, skywalks, roads**, and contour points using Total Station.
- Created a detailed spatial map.

### 6. Data Processing & Visualization
- Exported survey data to CSV.
- Imported and processed in **QGIS**.
- Styled and annotated map elements using **Survey of India standards**.
- Exported final map using QGIS **Print Composer**.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Importance of **geodetic control** and error minimization.
- Hands-on experience with **Total Station**, **Auto Level**, and **GNSS**.
- Skills in **spatial data transformation** and **QGIS visualization**.
- Understanding of **coordinate systems** and **map accuracy principles**.

## 📌 Tools & Technologies

- Total Station (for distance and angle measurements)
- Auto Level (for levelling)
- GNSS Receiver (for global coordinates)
- QGIS (for mapping and visualization)
- Bowditch’s Rule & Similarity Transformation (for adjustments)
